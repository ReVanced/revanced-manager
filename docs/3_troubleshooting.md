## üÜò Common issues

- **Patching fails with an error or patched app crashes**:

  - Reset the safeguard settings under `Settings` > `Advanced` to their default values
  - If a patch has options, reset them to their default values or correctly configure them
  - Make sure you are patching a full APK file and not an [APK bundle](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle/app-bundle-format)
- **Patches fail to load**: The selected file is not using the ReVanced API format or the remote URL is not reachable.
- **Patching takes too long**: Make sure you are using a device with enough storage space and free memory.
  Be patient during the patching process.

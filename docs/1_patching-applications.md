# 🧩 Patching applications
1. Tap the `Patcher` button in the bottom navigation bar.
2. Tap the `Select an application` card.
3. Here, you have the option to choose between selecting an app from on-device or selecting an APK file directly from storage.
   * For selecting on-device applications, tap on the desired app from the shown menu. For an app to show up in this list, the app must be already installed on the device.
     > **Warning**: This feature is incomplete for non-root users as ReVanced has yet to add split APK support. We suggest you pick your APK from storage for now.
   * To select from storage, click on the `Storage` button and select the APK normally through the file picker.
     > **Note**: We recommend downloading APK files from [APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/) as a temporary solution as `.apkm` and `.apks` files are not supported at the moment.
   * Verify that the selected application is a version supported by ReVanced. [See the list of supported versions for apps here.](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches#-patches)
4. After selecting an application, you will be brought back to the `Patcher` screen again. Tap the `Select patches` card.
5. Select your desired patches. Note that certain patches are required for non-root installations. (e.g. *MicroG Support* patch for YouTube)
6. Tap the `Done` button.
7. After selecting your patches, you will be brought back to the `Patcher` screen again. Tap the `Patch` button.
8. The app is now patching. This process can range from 2-10 minutes depending on your device. Refrain from closing the Manager.
9. When patching is complete, tap on the `Install` button. You may also tap on the three vertical dots in the top right to share logs or the patched APK.
   > **Warning**: If you close the Manager after patching, the patched APK file will be **automatically deleted from your device**!
